# Forge Compiler Warnings

## Expected Warnings from Dependencies

This project uses `forge-std` (Foundry Standard Library) as a dependency. The library currently generates deprecation warnings (Warning 2424) related to Natspec memory-safe-assembly comments.

### Warning Details

- **Warning Code**: 2424
- **Warning Message**: "Natspec memory-safe-assembly special comment for inline assembly is deprecated and scheduled for removal. Use the memory-safe block annotation instead."
- **Source**: `lib/forge-std/src/safeconsole.sol`
- **Impact**: None - these are deprecation warnings from a third-party library
- **Status**: Expected and safe to ignore

### Why These Warnings Appear

The `forge-std` library uses the deprecated `/// @solidity memory-safe-assembly` comment format in its `safeconsole.sol` file. The Solidity compiler recommends using the new `assembly ("memory-safe")` syntax instead, but the library hasn't been updated yet.

These warnings:
- ✅ Do not affect contract functionality
- ✅ Do not indicate security issues
- ✅ Come from third-party dependency code
- ✅ Will be resolved when forge-std library is updated

### Suppressing Warnings (Optional)

If you want to hide these warnings during development, you can filter them out:

```bash
# Filter out Warning 2424 from output
forge build 2>&1 | grep -v "Warning (2424)"

# Or suppress all warnings from lib directory
forge build 2>&1 | grep -v "lib/forge-std"
```

### Monitoring

We monitor for updates to `forge-std` that fix these warnings. Once the library is updated, these warnings should disappear.
